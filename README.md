# flipflop.css
A small, efficient, minimal, completely custom, and reusable bootstrap like css for my projects.

Simply put, I very much dislike big bulky prebuilt frameworks.  But some of the functionality of those frameworks would be nice.  So I started putting together my own that I can know line by line, class by class, etc.
